# Web Project for a presentation page

> NouryG

## About the project

This project is based on creating one of my first responsive webpage. It is meant to give its users a presentation on my own self just as a regular .pdf resume would do. This site was firstly created as part of a web project in Télécom Saint-Etienne, but given the interest it gave me, I decided to pursue it and develop it for myself.

## Structure

* `core/` regroups all the JS, PHP plugins that I use for the site.
* `css/` obviously regroups the css files I use.
* `favicons/` regroups the icons & logos I use for the website.
* `img/` will regroup every picture I use.
